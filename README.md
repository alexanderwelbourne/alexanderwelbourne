Alex is a PDRA at the University of Sheffield, working in spintronic neuromorphics as a magnetic/AI researcher exploring novel software and hardware architectures (neuromorphic spintronic computing) for ML. They are driven by exploring, enabling and communicating applications with impact. In their current role, this looks like designing and manufacturing new hardware and accompanying software solutions for AI. Whilst a lot of their github repos are currently private work ones, they're working on porting them to public repos where the team is happy to do so.
